# File-Compressor
This File Compressor is a Python-based application that utilizes Huffman coding for text compression. This tool provides an intuitive GUI built with Tkinter, enabling users to compress and decompress text files efficiently. The application uses a Huffman Tree data structure for encoding and decoding text, optimizing file sizes while maintaining data integrity.
